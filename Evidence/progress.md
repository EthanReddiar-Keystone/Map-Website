## Planning and Preparation

### Brain storming

I want to teach students about how to use maps. 
In a world where we have navigation to anywhere on the planet in our phones, we
loose our ability to navigation outside of these devices... Leading to students
or children unable to navigate places without an internet connection and device,
two things that are not garentteed to always be avaliable.

I want a way to let students explore maps and navigation in a way that is 
engaging and fun!

Noting this, I have come up with several success critera for my plans:
- Easy to pick up and use
- Focuses on students who are younger
- Fun and pretty!
- Sharable 

Easy to pick up means something that teachers can easily share with students,
that won't require explaining to use, no tutorials, just plug and play.

Focus on students means hitting the people who are most likely to be dependent
on digital maps to navigate. If even one of them takes away how to use a paper
map, the goal would have been reached. The more people that are aware and know
how to use paper maps the better!

Fun and Pretty! I want my creation to look poppy, and loud, attract attention 
without being overwhleming.

Making things sharable drives engagement, and that falls to a couple things:
- Am I able to compare my results to someone elses?
- Is this something I am likely to post online (is it a flex to have a good
result?)
- Will this get my friends to engage with what I am sharing?

Making things more sharable increases the amount of people willing and wanting
to engage, making it far more fun for the user to try and get the information.

### The Idea

For these reasons I believe the best solution to be an interactive quiz website. 

It's easy for teachers to simply share a link with their students for them to 
click and engage. I can theme this website to be children friendly, and have 
large buttons to make things easier to click for younger students. Not to
mention, interactablity, which drives engagment and fun! Much better then just
sitting through a long explaination video, allowing students to get hands on and
use their hands and minds to play around with the site.

Now for the magic! Mosaic!

Mosaic would be a collection of images based on how many questions the student
gets right. For example if they get question 2 and 6 right, they will get mosaic
piece number 2 and 6 in a collection which is sharable and easy to compare.

#### Themes

I have come up with a couple themes:
- ![Color Palette 1](https://github.com/EthanReddiar-Keystone/Map-Website/blob/main/Evidence/Images/Color%20Palette%201.png?raw=true)
- ![Color Palette 2](https://github.com/EthanReddiar-Keystone/Map-Website/blob/main/Evidence/Images/Color%20Palette%202.png?raw=true)
- ![Color Palette 3](https://github.com/EthanReddiar-Keystone/Map-Website/blob/main/Evidence/Images/Color%20Palette%203.png?raw=true)

I plan to itterate on these three, selecting the best one for the final site.

#### Website Layout

I am using a website called [Excalidraw](https://www.excalidraw.com) to draw 
some mockups of the website layout, finally settling on:

This has annotations on it explaining in detail each component.
